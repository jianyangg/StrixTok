## Preventing Abuse of Review Incentives with Advanced Computer Vision Techniques

StrixTok incorporates a robust Product Validation Computer Vision Model to thwart misuse and ensure the authenticity of reviews. Employing zero-shot learning and a CLIPSeg backbone, this model identifies the presence of the reviewed product using object segmentation and careful filtering.

Example:
- Step 1. User Gabriel posts a video review of his newly acquired headphones.
- Step 2. StrixTok's computer vision model diligently confirms that the headphones are indeed featured in the video.
- Step 3. The video is subjected to approval or rejection, and TikTok coins are distributed accordingly.
- Step 4. Users can also track whether their friends have purchased the same featured product, fostering a sense of community and shared interests.

## User Profiles

Within the user profile section, StrixTok showcases a user's purchase history and their liked items. This feature facilitates the discovery of shared interests among friends and can even serve as inspiration for thoughtful gift-giving.

## Conclusion

StrixTok has the potential to redefine the TikTok Shop experience or that of any e-commerce site, offering a more engaging, reliable, and interactive shopping journey. We invite you to explore our StrixTok app.
